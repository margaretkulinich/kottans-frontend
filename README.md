## Git and GitHub

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub
This course has helped me immensely in clearing most of the doubts I had when I started working with Git in general. 
Knowledge about revert and reset was a new for me.

Moreover, I'm going to use:
* git init
* git clone
* git add
* git commit
* git diff
* git reset
* git status
* git remote
* git push
* git pull
* git branch
* git checkout
  etc.

After the  learngitbranching.js.org challenged, I consolidated my knowledge and built a strong conceptual understanding of the technology.

Many thanks to instructors and organizers:-)
