## Git and GitHub

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub
This course has helped me immensely in clearing most of the doubts I had when I started working with Git in general. 
Knowledge about revert and reset was a new for me.

Moreover, I'm going to use:
* git init
* git clone
* git add
* git commit
* git diff
* git reset
* git status
* git remote
* git push
* git pull
* git branch
* git checkout
  etc.

After the  learngitbranching.js.org challenged, I consolidated my knowledge and built a strong conceptual understanding of the technology.


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1.Linux Survival
Unfortunately, I've never used Linux before, everything is new except "—Åd". Furthermore, I think that such basic commands will be useful:
* cd
* mkdir
* ls
* cp
* rm
* rmdir.

2. HTTP (part 1)
I refreshed my knowledge on URL structure, methods and status codes. It was surprising that PUT and DELETE are treated as specialized versions of the POST method and define the exact action: create, update, delete.
From the new: TRACE.
Of course, I'm going to use status codes (* a value returned by a procedure or function that indicates the state of the device or process), which helps to understand the error natures and how it handle. There is nothing to do in making client-server requests without understanding query method types and their differences.

3. HTTP (part 2)
In this part, I've learned extensively that there are several ways to collect identification, and most websites use a combination of them:
- Request Headers
- IP address of the client
- Fat Urls
- cookies.

Before, I didn't know about hashing, which contains so many functions and how complicated it is.


## Git Collaboration

1. Introduction to Git and GitHub (Week 3, 4)
In these modules, I learned the difference between Rebase and Merge, what a code review is and to utilize the code review workflow. It will help to me to decide which one is best for using some particular situation Furthermore, I was surprised by the information about the methodology behind continuous integration. Meanwhile, I'm going to use command relative to interaction with remote repository, operations on files, branches and reverting changes.



2. Fortunately, I had learned git before so I improved my technical skills with learngitbranching.js.org challange. git cherry-pick is new to me. It is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. 
The Flight Rules for Git guide has a lot of nuances and useful information to help me quickly solve a problem.



Many thanks to instructors and organizers :blush:
